There are some datasets available. We build the dataset01.pk (using main_build_dataset.py) for training purposes and the dataset_opera.pk (using main_build_dataset.py) to verify the model generability. <br>

The procedure to achieve a good model is: <br>
a) start the training using model_adam_200 (main_train_adam.py)  <br>
b) complete the training changing to main_train_lbfgs which results in model_adam_lbfgs model <br>
c) pay attention to the loss terms evolution to define a better set of weights <br>

The notebook pinn_operation_prediction.ipynb demonstrates the model capability during free prediction <br>

Routines to train with Adam and L-BFGS optimizers (requires tensor flow probability)<br>
Routines to restore models trained previously <br>

Feel free to contribute with software improvements.
